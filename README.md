# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis | SQL Data Analyst Project
## 📌 Project Summary

This project demonstrates an end-to-end sales data analysis using SQL to extract actionable insights from a relational database of a pizza restaurant.

### The goal of the analysis was to answer key business questions related to:

- Revenue performance

- Customer ordering behavior

- Product demand

- Sales trends over time

By leveraging SQL, the project converts raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence that can support strategic decision-making.

## 🎯 Business Problem

The restaurant needed insights to:

- Identify top-performing products

- Optimize staff during peak hours

- Improve inventory planning

- Increase overall revenue

## 🗂️ Dataset & Data Model

The analysis was performed using four relational tables:

- orders – order date & time

- order_details – quantity per order

- pizzas – size & pricing

- pizza_types – category & product details

These tables were joined to build a complete sales view.

## 📊 Key Metrics Delivered

- ✅ Total Orders: 21,350

- ✅ Total Revenue: $817,860.05

- ✅ Average Pizzas Sold per Day: 138

- ✅ Peak Order Hours Identified

- ✅ Category-wise Revenue Contribution

- ✅ Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity

- ✅ Top 3 Pizzas by Revenue (per category)

- ✅ Cumulative Revenue Trend

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🍕 Large size pizzas are the most ordered → high demand product

- 🏆 Classic & Supreme categories generate the highest revenue

- ⏰ Peak sales: 12 PM–1 PM and 5 PM–7 PM → staffing optimization opportunity

- 📉 XL & XXL sizes have very low demand → reduce inventory

- 💰 Premium pizzas can be used for bundle strategy to increase AOV
